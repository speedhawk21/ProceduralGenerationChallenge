# 10-Day Procedural Generation Challenge: Unity 6 – Creativity Unleashed

Join this 10-day journey creating procedural generation features in Unity 6. Each day unveils a new technique, from simple noise-based patterns to an integrated mini-world by Day 10. Progress is shared via daily GIFs, screenshots, and tips using #ProceduralChallenge #Unity6.

## Objective

Build one procedural feature daily. By Day 10, fuse them together to form a cohesive mini-world, highlighting how procedural generation brings depth and replayability to game development.

## Features

- **Day 1: Infinite Noise Pattern** – Scrollable 2D Perlin noise texture.
- **Day 2: Random Tree Scatter** – Noise-driven tree placement.
- **Day 3: Wavy Terrain** – Perlin noise-based terrain deformation.
- **Day 4: Crystal Growth** – Iterative crystal formations with procedural logic.
- **Day 5: Maze Generator** – Classic 2D maze using recursive backtracking.
- **Day 6: Procedural River** – Winding river dynamically carved into terrain.
- **Day 7: Growing Vine System** – Organic vine propagation over surfaces.
- **Day 8: Randomized Village** – Houses placed procedurally for variety.
- **Day 9: Weathered Ruins** – Decaying structures with noise-based erosion.
- **Day 10: Procedural Mini-World** – Final synthesis of all features with animations.
